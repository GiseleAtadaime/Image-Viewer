Version 0.4.2

-----------------------------------------------------
Description:

A simple image viewer made back in 2016 in the beginning of programming classes at college.
It's made in VB.NET and with a very messy and ugly code, but it works! Keep in mind that at that time
I was still learning the basics.
Supposedly it only works on windows (Was made on Visual Studio afterall) as it's saving system relies in renaming the
files, whose are already image files but with no extension (no ".jpeg" at all), to claim the "convert" idea. Since windows
assign a proper software for each type of file, this Image Viewer does it's job properly if you are too lazy to rename your 
image files.
It also has some unavailable features that MAYBE will never be made true, but rest assured that a new Image viewer is currently in progress,
but at a slow pace, in VB.NET  and using OOP. Comming soon (or never).

If you, I don't know why and how, have any interest in this project, let me know.

THANK YOU FOR SPARING SOME OF YOUR PRECIOUS TIME TO READ THIS.


DISCLAIMER:

I can write codes 1000x better now (2018). This project is but a glimpse of a distant past.
